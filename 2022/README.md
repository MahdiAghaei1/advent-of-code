# AOC 2022
Technically this is the first AOC I attempt. I'm gonna try it in TypeScript but I would love to solve all the puzzles with a functional programming approach.

## Usage
Run eachday's code with the actual input (inside `input.txt`) like `yarn ts-node [DAY_DIR]`. for example:
```sh
  yarn ts-node day01
```
